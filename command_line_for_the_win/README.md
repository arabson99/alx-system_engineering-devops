I uploaded the screenshot from my local machine to the virtual machine using SFTP command-line tool
The steps I follow in uploading the screenshot using sftp are below:

2. sftp username@hostname and insert your VM password
3. Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots.
